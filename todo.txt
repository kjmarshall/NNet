1) Different neural net architectures
   a) CNN
   b) RNN
   c) LSTM
   d) autoencoder
2) Weight regularization
3) Different design patterns
4) Time series prediction
5) Saving and loading
6) try catch error handeling

## TODO: Goals
* Develop training accuracy and testing accuracy outputs and plotting capabilities, confusion matrix for minst
* Format network info printer as table (possibly use fmtlib)
* Finish developing network serialization, saving, and loading
* Proofread docs
* Run more examples
* Produce training and testing accuracy plot
* Check library files and structure
* Release first project version

Extra Goals
* Enhance with different net architectures CNNs, RBMs, etc...
* CUDA and or parallelize
* Qt for live display outputs
